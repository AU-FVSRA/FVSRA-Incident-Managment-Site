# FVSRA-Incident-Managment-Site (CSC4350)
The primary goal of this project is to modernize, improve upon, and better organize current processes and procedures within the Fox Valley Special Rec agency. At the current moment, all injury reports are done through pen and paper and later categorized by severity and if necessary addressed during a weekly staff meeting. The goal of this project is to create a digital interface/website to allow those responsible for submitting injury reports an easier and more efficient way of doing so. Rather than waiting, printing a form, and submitting the form at a later date through the proper channels, a digital interface will greatly speed up the reporting procedure as well as any necessary follow up.


# Project Description / Definition
Incident Management System

As an operations manager at Fox Valley Special Recreation, I need a system that helps us document and manage safety incidents. 

Ideally, someone on staff could create a document (say google docs) and submit the incident information that would trigger an alert to our safety team. An alert would trigger a safety meeting where we would review it. Minor incidents would just be reviewed at our regular meetings. If it is more serious, it could initiate a form to send to a risk management group. 

An incident, is anything that must be documented. For example, when working with youth it might be a band aid, ice pack, or other first aid or even a 911 call. An incident could have happened to a youth, staff, or be property damage or even a vehicle issue. I current see these types of incidents:

- Patron incident accident
-	vehicle damage
-	property damage
-	employee accident form 

For each type of incident, a separate form would be required to be filled out with different questions. It might include classifying the incident as major, minor or other severities. Different roles might get alerted to the incident based on incident type. 

During our analysis process we would like to tag each incident as minor or major and indicate if follow up is required. The safety committee might review each incident. If it is more serious, it would tag it, fill out more details and send it along for further assessment. 

The incidents need to be able to be entered (and later viewed) on a variety of devices that include mobile (android/Apple) and PCs. 

An admin role would need access to view all incidents, record notes and update fields.
